Enforcing least privilege also helps to minimize the effects of unauthorized access to software user accounts. To limit access to sensitive data, functions, and resources to only those accounts that require such access, the level of privilege and access required should be defined and documented for each built-in account in an access matrix such that its assigned functions may be performed, but no additional or unnecessary access or privileges are granted."

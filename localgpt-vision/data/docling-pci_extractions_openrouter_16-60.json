For example, system service accounts  that the software uses to operate, or accounts used  by the software to access underlying components  such as a database or invoke web-services calls  should not require permissions that exceed the  minimum necessary for the software to perform its  operations.  The same concept applies to resources used by the  software. The software should be granted access to  only the minimum required resources for its  expected operation. For example, mobile  applications that do not require access to the  camera or photographs should not request such  access unless they are a necessary part of the  software architecture.

Applying the principle of least privilege to user  accounts helps prevent users without sufficient  knowledge about the software from incorrectly or  accidentally changing the software configuration or  its security settings. Enforcing least privilege also  helps to minimize the effects of unauthorized access  to software user accounts.  To limit access to sensitive data, functions, and  resources to only those accounts that require such  access, the level of privilege and access required  should be defined and documented for each built-in  account in an access matrix \uf02c  such that its assigned  functions may be performed, but no additional or  unnecessary access or privileges are granted."
